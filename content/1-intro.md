If a story is brought together by your data, visuals and narratives- letâ€™s start by looking at your data.  

Data is the basis of your research, where you derive your insights.  

Data starts off as numbers and letters but by exploring the relationships between your data, you create information.  

This information is great, but you need to explain what this information means .. creating Knowledge.  

This knowledge is what we want to share with people.
